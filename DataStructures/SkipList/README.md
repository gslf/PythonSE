# Skip List in Python
Skip Lists are an ingenious probabilistic data structure designed to maintain ordered collections of elements efficiently. They are often used as a substitute for balanced trees, combining simplicity with excellent performance in search, insertion, and deletion operations. 

A Skip List is an ordered linked list augmented with multiple layers of additional links, enabling logarithmic-time operations. These additional links allow elements to be "skipped" during traversal, hence the name. Unlike binary search trees, which rely on a rigid balancing mechanism, Skip Lists achieve balance probabilistically by randomly assigning levels to each element.

Imagine you're managing a list of book IDs in a library. You want to search, insert, or delete IDs efficiently. A simple linked list requires traversing all elements linearly, while a Skip List adds shortcuts to accelerate these operations.

Suppose you have the following IDs: 1, 3, 7, 8, 10. Hereâ€™s how they would be structured in a Skip List:

- At the base level (Level 0), all IDs are linked sequentially.
- At higher levels, some IDs are "promoted" to create shortcuts.
