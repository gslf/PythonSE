# AVL Tree in Python

The AVL Tree (named after its inventors Adelson-Velsky and Landis) is a self-balancing binary search tree. Its core feature is that the difference in height between the left and right subtrees of any node (called the balance factor) is at most 1. This balance guarantees logarithmic time complexity for operations such as insertion, deletion, and lookup, making it a powerful tool for applications requiring efficient sorted data access.

To grasp the AVL tree intuitively, letâ€™s visualize its balancing process:
- **Insertion:** When a new node is added, the balance factor of affected nodes is recalculated. If a node becomes unbalanced (balance factor is less than -1 or greater than 1), rotations (single or double) are applied to restore balance.
- **Rotations:**
    - **Right Rotation (RR):** When the left subtree is too tall, the right rotation shifts nodes rightward.
    - **Left Rotation (LL):** When the right subtree is too tall, the left rotation shifts nodes leftward.
    - **Left-Right (LR) and Right-Left (RL):** These occur when the tree requires two rotations to resolve imbalance.

The keypoint of AVL Trees is the **balance**. An unbalanced binary search tree deteriorates into a linked list, losing its efficiency.

## Implementation

Here is a minimalistic implementation of an AVL Tree in Python:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, key):
        """
        Node structure for AVL Tree.
        Each node contains:
        - key: The value of the node
        - left: Reference to the left child (initially None)
        - right: Reference to the right child (initially None)
        - height: Height of the node (default is 1 for new nodes)
        """
        self.key = key
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
        self.height = 1  # Height is important for balancing the AVL Tree

class AVLTree:
    def get_height(self, node):
        """
        Returns the height of a given node.
        If the node is None, height is 0.
        """
        return node.height if node else 0

    def get_balance(self, node):
        """
        Calculates and returns the balance factor of a node.

        # Update heights after rotation
        x.height = 1 + max(self.get_height(x.left), self.get_height(x.right))
        y.height = 1 + max(self.get_height(y.left), self.get_height(y.right))

        return y  # New root after rotation

    def insert(self, root, key):
        """
        Inserts a new key into the AVL Tree rooted at 'root'.
        Balances the tree after insertion if necessary.
        """
        # Step 1: Perform standard BST insertion

        balance = self.get_balance(root)

        # Step 4: Check for imbalance and perform rotations if needed

        # Left Left Case (unbalanced due to left-heavy subtree)
        if balance > 1 and key < root.left.key:
            return self.rotate_right(root)

# Example usage
tree = AVLTree()
root = None

# Insert elements into the AVL Tree
elements = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 25]
for elem in elements:
    root = tree.insert(root, elem)
